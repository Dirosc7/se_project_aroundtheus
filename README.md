1. The project's name - Around the US

2. Description - An interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

3. Description of the technology and techniques used:
   Work with designs in a graphics editor called Figma
   Create responsive websites using Grid Layout
   Use media queries to set parameters for different screen sizes
   Work with branches in Git
   Create your own array of data
   Add markup code for the modal window
   Access and toggle the modal window
   Add more functionality to the project with JavaScript

   Create a .js file for your index.html page. Make sure to name it as index.js and to store it in the /scripts folder inside the project.
   Data on larger sites are stored in databases where users can upload their information, and edit or delete it. We’ll study databases in later sprints, but the first step to understanding them is learning how to work with arrays.
   Create an array and store it in the initialCards variable. The array should consist of a minimum of six objects, each having two fields: name and link. In the next task, you’ll add data from these objects to the cards on your page. The name field should contain a string with a place name, and the link field should contain a URL to the picture of this place. You can choose the photos and names you’d like to use on the cards. We suggest using https://unsplash.com to find photos for your projects. This site is a collection of free photos that can be used without worrying about copyrights.
   But if you don't have time or ideas, you can simply use the following data based on the cards from the previous project:
