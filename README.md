1. The project's name - Around the US

2. Description - An interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

3. Create a .js file for your index.html page. Make sure to name it as index.js and to store it in the /scripts folder inside the project.
   Data on larger sites are stored in databases where users can upload their information, and edit or delete it. We’ll study databases in later sprints, but the first step to understanding them is learning how to work with arrays.
   Create an array and store it in the initialCards variable. The array should consist of a minimum of six objects, each having two fields: name and link. In the next task, you’ll add data from these objects to the cards on your page. The name field should contain a string with a place name, and the link field should contain a URL to the picture of this place.

   This part of the project had us:
   Create your own array of data
   Add markup code for the modal window
   Access and toggle the modal window
   Add more functionality to the project with JavaScript.

By the end we will have:
master the basics of JavaScript.
learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS through JavaScript.
learn how to fix bugs and errors in your JS code.
