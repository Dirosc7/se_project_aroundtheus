1. The project's name - Around the US

2. Description - An interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

3. Technologies and techniques used - working with a Figma design (- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)) that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px), I used Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries, and percentage values to create a a fluid grid system: A fluid grid system is a layout system that uses percentage values to define the width of columns and rows. This allows the layout to scale to different screen sizes without breaking. I also created responsive images and fonts for different screen sizes and tested across browsers to make sure that it looks and works correctly on all devices. JavaScript has been added to keep data seperate from the markup.
