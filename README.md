1. The project's name - Around the US

2. Description - An interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

3. Technologies and techniques used - using JavaScript to create arrays and objects to store data away from markup. This principle for working with data that you’re starting to learn is fundamental when developing web services, and you’ll be mastering these skills right up until you start working with databases. Your first step on this path will be to add a script file to your project and create an array with the card data. Create an array and store it in the initialCards variable. The array should consist of a minimum of six objects, each having two fields: name and link. In the next task, you’ll add data from these objects to the cards on your page. The name field should contain a string with a place name, and the link field should contain a URL to the picture of this place.
