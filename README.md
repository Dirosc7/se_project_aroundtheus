1. The project's name - Around the US

2. Description - An interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

3. Technologies and techniques used - for my responsive page design is now using JavaScript to create arrays and objects to store data away from markup. This principle for working with data is fundamental when developing web services. First step was to add a script file to your project and create an array with the card data. The array consists of six objects, each having two fields: name and link. The name field should contain a string with a place name, and the link field should contain a URL to the picture of this place.

4. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features (highly recommended)
